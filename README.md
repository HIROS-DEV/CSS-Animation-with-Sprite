Today is holiday.
So, I learned CSS Animation with Sprite Sheet for just enjoyment.

I watched the below Youtube Video.

(I hope that I would like to someone like him in the future.)

## Purpose of the project

Just for my enjoyment.

## What did I learn from this project?

<p>How to use Sprite Sheet with CSS</p>
<p>How to animate character in HTML Pages</p>

I think that the project method can use animation logo or footer logo in web page.
Of course, I can use in the main section too.
It is impact for visiting user, I think.

Thank you for reading. And, happy coding!!!
